function ep_rejoinChunks(inFileName, outFileName, outputFormat, chunkNum, eventSuffix, subjectSpecSuffix, theFunctionArgs)%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% ep_rejoinChunks(inFileName, outFileName, outputFormat, chunkNum) - rejoins file chunks into a full session file%%	Reads in file chunks generated by chunkInputFile function and writes them out%	as a reconstituted session file of the desired type.%%Inputs%	inFileName: filename (not including the .mat suffix or chunk number.  e.g., "NT5-01") and sourcepath.%	outFileName: Output filesname and sourcepath.  No suffix.%   outputFormat: The file format for the written out file.%	chunkNum: Number of chunks for subject%   eventSuffix: Suffix for event files if needed (e.g., "_evt.txt")%   subjectSpecSuffix : The suffix added to subject spec text files (e.g., "_sub.txt").%   theFunctionArgs: the arguments used for the artifact correction function call for addition to the .history field.%%	Inputs file chunks for each subject.%%Outputs%	Saves reconstituted session file.%% History:%% by Joseph Dien (8/00)% jdien07@mac.com%% modified 5/26/02 JD% output set to always be bigendian no matter what computer is running this code.%% bugfix 11/24/02 JD% closes output file when done.%% modified 5/27/03 JD% Renamed rejoinEGISchunks for greater clarity.%% bugfix 4/1/04 JD% Allow for spaces in file names.%% bugfix 3/22/07 JD% Eliminated warnings about rounding to 16 bits.%% modified 2/17/08 JD% Eliminated file type option for OS 9 macs as obsolete.%% modified (9/9/08) JD% Automatically sets File Type and Creator Type if on an OS X Mac%% modified (11/20/08) JD% Automatically sets montage type if on an OS X Mac.% Modified to accept chunks generated by chunkInputFile and thus a wider range of file formats.%% modified and bugfix (1/31/09) JD% allows for data with multiple events per trial but only one at stimulus onset.%% modified 3/14/09 JD% Changed to use EP format data to provide more flexibility with I/O functions.% and changed name to rejoinChunks.%% modified 6/22/09 JD% Added bad data fields from preprocessing.%% modified 9/22/09 JD% Modified to handle continuous files.%% bugfix 10/31/09 JD% Crash for non-continuous data files.
